## What is this?
A collection of scripts for setting up a notebook with a fresh debian installation.
It's tailored to my needs and my machine.

## How to use?
Before you wipe your machine to set it up with a fresh installation, clone the repo and put it to a USB stick (or something else). After debian was installed, execute the *setup.0.sh*. It will then install everything I need.
